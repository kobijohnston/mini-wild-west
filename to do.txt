NEXT UP TO DO - BLACKJACK:
	-Make Area2D on entered, show a tooltip to play blackjack:
		-Almost done with tooltips, need to make it so they arent set every frame ->
			-Make a change_state or change_tooltip function, make a on_body_exited for the blackjack table to change tooltip back when player leaves.
			Need to make it so tooltip doesnt try to update every frame maybe? last_tooltip variable then would be needed.
	-Make key press begin blackjack game (use a text label in blackjack.tscn to test)
	-Begin development of blackjack game - notes in yellow book
	
	

Feature wishlist:
	-Lawmen that respond to you shooting innocents or them 
	-Money
	-General store: Sells food for healing, guns, ammunition
	-Blackjack table in the saloon
	-Bounty posters: Interacting spawns an outlaw in the town you can hunt for money
	-Character customisation: jackets, hats, gun, shoes
	-Towns:
		-Amarillo
		-Agua Fria
		-El Paso
		-Tombstone?
		-Juarez?
	

Think about:
	-Character rescale to 16x32?
	-Completion for each town:
		-Hunt down all outlaws in the town
		-Bankrupt the blackjack dealer
		-Win a game of poker
		-Buy the special item from that town
		-Kill all the lawmen in the town
		Potential idea:
